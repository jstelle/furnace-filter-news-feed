                                                    <p>The HVAC system in your home is an essential part of keeping you comfortable throughout the different seasons. It helps regulate your indoor temperature and humidity levels so that you can stay comfortable no matter what the weather is like outside. However, even with the best HVAC system, you may not be able to escape the occasional inconvenience of having to replace the filter inside your furnace or air conditioner on a regular basis. It can be a bit of a nuisance, but at least you know that the filter is there for a good reason – to trap dust and other contaminants before they make their way into your home through the vents. But what happens if you don’t replace your filter on time or don’t replace it at all? Can a dirty filter cause health problems? Let’s take a closer look at this dilemma and see if there’s anything you can do about it before it’s too late.</p><h2>What is a filter?</h2><p>A filter is a device that helps trap contaminants in the air before they enter your home. They are a staple of any HVAC system, and are usually placed inside the ductwork leading into your home. They’re usually either square or cylindrical in shape, depending on the type of HVAC system you have.Air filters are usually made from a combination of natural and synthetic materials, such as cotton, fiberglass, or even metal wool. They trap a variety of contaminants in the air, including dust, pet dander, and even bacteria. They are designed to be changed on a regular basis to help keep your HVAC system running smoothly and efficiently.</p><h2>Why is it important to replace your filter?</h2><p>Air filters are essential to maintaining clean air in your home. They trap harmful contaminants such as dust, pet dander, and pollen, which can otherwise cause allergic reactions and other health problems. A dirty filter can lead to an increase in allergens and other contaminants in the air, which can make your home unpleasantly stuffy and uncomfortable. They also help regulate the flow of air into your home, which can help lower your utility bills.Air filters are an important part of any HVAC system, so it’s important to replace them regularly. There are a few ways to tell if your filter needs to be replaced. If you can see through the filter, it’s time to get a new one. If you can smell the filter when you turn on your HVAC system, it’s also probably time to replace it. And if the filter makes a loud crunching sound when you turn on your HVAC system, it’s probably time to replace it too.</p><h2>How often should you replace your filter?</h2><p>The frequency with which you need to replace your filter will depend on the type of HVAC system you have and the quality of air in your home. If you have an air conditioner, you should replace your filter once a month. If you have a furnace, you should replace your filter every three months or whenever your filter gets visibly dirty.If you have allergies or asthma and are highly susceptible to allergies, you should probably replace your filter even more often, every two or three weeks. This is especially important if you have a humidifier in your home, as the water vapor produced by the humidifier can increase the amount of dust and other contaminants in the air.</p><h2>How to know if your filter needs replacing?</h2><p>There are a few signs that will let you know if your filter needs replacing. If you can see through your filter, it’s time to get a new one. If you can smell the filter when you turn on your HVAC system, it’s also probably time to replace it. And if the filter makes a loud crunching sound when you turn on your HVAC system, it’s probably time to replace it too.If you live in an area with high humidity, you may also want to check the humidity level of your home. If the humidity level is too high, it may indicate that your filter needs replacing. If you have a humidifier in your home, you may also want to consider changing your filter more often.</p><h2>Bottom line</h2><p>The bottom line is that it’s important to replace your filter on a regular basis to keep your HVAC system running smoothly. It’s also important to know when to replace your filter to avoid dirty air and potential health hazards.If you have a dirty filter, it’s important to get it replaced as soon as possible. This will help ensure that your HVAC system is running smoothly, and that you’re staying as healthy as possible.</p>

For colder zones, you might want to change it every 30 – 60 days because furnaces usually go on for many months and do not take a break. For warmer areas, you may only replace it twice during the winter or after 90 days. It also varies on the thickness of the furnace filters. The thinner your filter, the more frequent you get to replace it.</span></span>

Furnace filters make sure that contaminants, dust, and microbes do not get inside your house so you will not breathe dirty air. </span></span>
